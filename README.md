# Real-time COVID-19 Face Mask Recognition.
A gentle exploration of Deep Learning in the context of Face Recognition. 
The project is structured into three directories:
1. **FaceRecognition/**
   A system that simplifies face extraction, recognition, and storage.
2. **MaskRecognition/**
   A python notebook describing the process of training and testing a face mask detector model
3. **MaskFaceRecognition/**
   A program that uses functionalities of FaceRecogniton/ combined with the trained model from MaskRecognition/ to conduct mask vs name recognition.
