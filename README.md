# James Rocco Facial Recognition Project
A gentle exploration of Deep Learning in the context of Face Recognition.  
## Identity-Match
Using Convolutional Neural Network to extract a vector representation of a given face and computing distance between vectors to verify same person.
## Mask-No-Mask-Classifier
Experimenting with Transfer Learning to obtain a model with the best face mask detection performance metrics.
